<p>[<i>The Drawing-room in a biggish suburban villa—The furniture, &amp;c., are in
middling taste. <span class="name">EDGAR TIMBRELL,</span> an ordinary young man of nearly
thirty in neat tweeds is sprawling self-consciously on the sofa. <span
class="name">ADA</span> and <span class="name">SHEILA</span> are opening a parcel. They
are the ordinary middle-class young women who might develop in all manner of unexpected
ways and usually do not.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Come and look, Edgar.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> He’s only pretending not to care.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Lend me your knife. [<i>She takes it from him and
cuts the string.</i>] I brought this over without opening it just to let you see it
too.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> For Heaven’s sake remember who sent them all.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> It’s all right. Ada’s keeping a list.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Well, get all the fun out of it you can. You won’t
often have the chance of being married.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> [<i>Opening the parcel.</i>] Oh! how nice! What do
you mean, Edgar? I’ve had lots of chances.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You can’t go on having them now, though.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> Let me see, Sheila.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> No, that’s why I want everything to be nice. Instead
of all those chances I want one delightful reality. A sweet little tea caddy; that’s two;
the other was bigger. One delightful reality, Edgar. You’ve got to see to that.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Oh! I’ll make a jolly good husband.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> I wasn’t thinking of that. I was only thinking of the
wedding. One thing at a time. I<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg
6]</a></span> want to have the prettiest wedding that ever was. Something that I can look
back to. No hitches and stupidities and uglinesses.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> Some people like Indian tea. You could have Indian tea
in that one.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="name">MARY BROOME,</span> the
</i>housemaid.<i> She is a comely young woman in the housemaid’s usual afternoon dress and
with the housemaid’s usual self-possession.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> A parcel for you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Thank you. Will you put it down—anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> Another present! No.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Only my new silk hat.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Hurrah! That’s right.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">MARY</span> puts the box on a chair and is
going out when <span class="name">EDGAR</span> speaks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Er—is Mr. Leonard in, do you know?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I think he went upstairs, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> What do you want with him?</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Let’s see you in the new hat.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> It’s just a notion I had. I’m afraid of forgetting. I
wonder if he’s done anything about clothes and things; he’s fearfully casual.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Must I—? Do you want me, sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> No, I think not, thank you.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> The new hat. The new hat. How jolly!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She begins to open the box.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> You’d better speak to him while you think about it.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> He’s no good at ceremonial clothes. I believe he’s
only got a frock coat.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Oh! don’t let us have a frock coat. I should never
forget it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> I’ll go for him. I’ll fetch him.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Yes, do, Ada. No time like the present. [<i><span
class="name">ADA</span> goes out.</i>] Edgar, I wish Leonard wasn’t coming to the
wedding.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> But, my dear girl—</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Oh! I know. I know. Of course he <i>must</i> be best
man. It would be all wrong if he wasn’t but somehow he’s so queer and different and I
don’t feel safe with him and I don’t know what he’ll do or say. Of course he can be
charming. I think he’s a flirt. You always know when he’s in the room.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Of course these artist people are very self-conscious
and assertive and—</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> But he’s not assertive. He’s—he’s seductive. And he
makes fun of things.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> No harm in that.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Yes, there is. He makes fun of the wrong things. Why
do you call him an artist, Edgar? He’s not one.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Oh! he’s artistic—literary and so on—It’s all the
same.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> But he’s a barrister, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Oh! yes, of sorts. He never had a brief.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Then how does he—I mean how does he get an income?
Why doesn’t he go into the business, too?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Oh! ho! Leonard in the business! No. The old Pater
prefers to pay him a handsome allowance to keep out. Besides, Leonard makes about five
shillings a month by literature.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> How horrid to be quite dependent like that! Why do
you let him?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Bless you! I don’t want him in the business. It suits
me well enough. Hullo! He’s coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="name">ADA</span> and <span
class="name">LEONARD.</span></i>] [<i><span class="name">LEONARD</span> is rather younger
than <span class="name">EDGAR;</span> a handsome young man with an air of detachment. His
manners are rather pleasantly impudent and now disguise some harassment. He is rather
carefully dressed in what appears to be a careless way.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m wanted? Very much honoured I’m sure. My dear
Sheila, I kiss your hands.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> You may shake one if you like.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He tries to kiss it and she snatches it away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What a pity.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Don’t be so stupid.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You keep disappointing me. We should have done it
very well.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> Don’t be absurd, Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> He will play the fool.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, well. Now to business. About this wedding.
Does the best man kiss the bride?</p>

<p class="simul_top"><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not. Those vulgarities are out
of date.</p>

<p class="simul_mid">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;[<i>Together.</i>]</p>

<p class="simul_bottom"><span class="name">EDGAR.</span>&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deuce take it, Leonard!</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I only want to know. I want to play my part like an
English gentleman. Kissing in public—except the hand—is an atrocity, but if it has to be
done it should be done firmly. No hesitations, no scrimmages. In fact there should always
be a rehearsal. Very well. No kissing. Now about gloves—</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Yes, what are you going to wear, Leonard?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I shall wear a grey morning coat, trousers of about
the same colour but exquisitely striped, white waistcoat, grey hat with narrow black band,
an orchid—the best that money can buy—if anyone will lend me the money—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Here, I say—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I know what you are going to say—that I ought just
to dress up to you.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Oh! he won’t be sensible. I hope you won’t go and
spoil things.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Spoil things? [<i>He reflects for a moment.</i>]
Confess that you would like me to go away and telegraph that I can’t come to the
wedding.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Oh! No. But I want everything to be nice.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Do the thing properly, Leonard.</p>

<p class="before_indent_text"><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Properly! I want to do
things more than properly. I meant to write an ode on the marriage morning. I’m afraid I
shan’t have time for more than a sonnet. I’ve made a start. I’ve got a first line:</p>

<p class="indent_text">‘The jocund sun has tinged the mountain tops’—</p>

<p class="after_indent_text">Good word ‘jocund’. The difficulty is to get three good
rhymes to tops. Of course it might be crest—mountain crest—but I don’t like it. It’s
poetical. That’s the worst of poetry now-a-days; you mustn’t use poetical words.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> There’s no getting any sense out of you, but look
here: Sheila and I want you to be decent over this affair. Just get the right sort of
thing and a new hat, won’t you? I’ll tell you what to get if you like.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> My dear fellow I have the sense of clothes.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> He knows well enough, Edgar.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Come on then. Is mother downstairs?</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> I think so. Leonard, you might open the window; the
room’s close.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Now, Ada, you know it’s not my business<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span> to open the window. I
always leave this kind of thing to experts.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You’re packing a bag. What for? You can’t be going
away?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Now you mustn’t stop here. Anyone may come in.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> After what I told you, you’re going away? You couldn’t
do that.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And, look here! My mother’s talking about having
missed a photograph—my photograph. You’ve never, surely—</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, I took it.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! but that’s madness.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I thought I had a right to it.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, get away, that’s a good girl. We’ll talk about
things again.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> How can you go away? Why are you packing your bag?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’ve been spying in my room.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You know I have to go into your room.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Of course. I beg your pardon. Yes, I am going away
for two days.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> There were ten shirts laid out.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m lying. Yes. We can’t talk here. Who’s this? Take
care. [<i>As <span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL</span> enters he continues:</i>] Well, I

Well, Mother? [<i>He turns from <span class="name">MARY</span> with an air of dismissal.

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’d better let Mary go, Mother. You can’t scold
her in public like this. Besides it was only a trifle.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I said it was beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> What’s beautiful?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">MARY.</span></i>] What
are you stopping here for? Have you no sense of shame? [<i><span class="name">MARY</span>

I don’t know. It’s a disagraceful affair. Disagraceful. Now, be off. Be off. Please
go.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> But I want to hear what he says.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Yes. So do I.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> The devil of it is that I say anything. If you get
me into a fix I just want to get out of it.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> That’s your character, is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> From your point of view, sir, I’m afraid I’m a bad
lot.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> What good are you to anybody? Why were you
born?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> That’s your concern, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Don’t bandy words with me. You should be down on
your knees asking pardon of this poor girl, of your Mother, of your God. What are such
things to you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m extremely sorry. Of course I’ve no defence. I
should have to go back to some kind of first principles and even then it’d be a bit shaky
I daresay. Mother, it’s horrible for you. I see that.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> But have you nothing to say? Do you think this is
adequate? What are you going to do? What’s your way out?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You have a better head than I have, sir, for these
practical matters.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> You are a callous and impudent fellow. [<i>To <span

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I can’t make out how much he cares.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">MARY.</span></i>] I don’t
know what to<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span> say
to you. I can’t talk to you in public. This is a new aspect of the thing entirely. What’s
the use of telling you I’m sorry?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Are you sorry?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Is the beauty of the scene waning?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">EDGAR.</span></i>] You’ll
want another best man. Well, Sheila didn’t want me.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Don’t speak of Sheila here.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Your own sense of decency might tell you.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Passionately.</i>] In all my life I never said
anything as bad as that. Never anything as unkind, as evil, as abominable.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Why, what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> To insult her now!</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You’re a fine fellow to talk of—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Silence. This is no time for such bickering. [<i>To
<span class="name">MARY.</span></i>] Just leave the room.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Don’t speak to her like that.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Are you addressing me?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes. You must treat her well.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Treat her!—What are you to talk of treating her
well? Besides, I am treating her well. I think she will agree that I have shown the
greatest forebearance. A fellow who has an intrigue with a servant and then—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> A servant!</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> What is she?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You make these distinctions.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> What does the fellow mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’d hardly believe it but I feel a kind of moral
exaltation. [<i><span class="name">EDGAR</span> laughs.</i>] Oh! yes, Edgar, I know your
vast superiority but in this you’re despicable through and through—all of you.<span

beautifully kind for a moment just now. She asked Mary to sit down. [<i>Impetuously.</i>]

<p class="before_indent_text"><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’ve wronged you, as the
saying is, but I don’t wrong you with every instinct, at every hour of the day. After all,
I’m the only member of this family that’s achieved any kind of human relationship with

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Come.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> [<i>Going, turns and says to <span

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He was packing his things.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Why, Leonard?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What a brute I am.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You were going away?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> That’s the kind of beast I am.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I don’t quite understand this. You were going away?
Where? Why?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Where doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Why were you going?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I wanted to get out of it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You didn’t know. You didn’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes, I did. She told me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> But, Leonard—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> What! What! You were running away? You knew—you
knew everything?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes, I did.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Shameful! Monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I thought it the most sensible thing to do. I know
it looks bad.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> He amazes me. I can’t grasp it. What a coward! What
an infamous coward! Had you no thought at all for this unfortunate girl? You never thought
of any kind of reparation, I suppose? Reparation! By Heaven!—[<i>He stops for a moment,
considering and then goes on but with something working in his mind.</i>] Had you no
consideration for your Mother—for any of us? Don’t you see—don’t you understand?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I think I see a bit clearer than you do. As to Mary,
I didn’t see how I could help her. Frankly, I didn’t. I knew you’d be as decent to her as
anyone could. I’ve not a penny. I can’t earn a penny. I’d have written to my mother to
explain. It wouldn’t have been pleasant, but less disagreeable for her than this, I
think.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> How would you go away without a penny?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Never mind. Yes. You shall know. I meant to take
some of mother’s housekeeping money. I know where she keeps it.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You’d have stolen it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I should have written to explain—and to ask for some
more.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You’re the limit.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’re damned small-minded. Don’t bother us. [<i>To
his father.</i>] I quite understand your point of view, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Oh! do you? You understand me very thoroughly,
don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You see I have far more faith in your practical
wisdom than in my own. I’m in a mess. You’ll say I ought to stop and face the music. My
point is that it does no good. And then there was that infernal wedding of Edgar’s; I had
to get out of that. They didn’t want me any how. Oh! I know I cut a very poor figure. From
your point of view. And I quite understand it, mind you. I’m very much with you now. And
when I look at you, Mary, I feel rather horrible.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I didn’t think you’d have run away.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No, that’s bad, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> The fellow’s a Comedian.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Come, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Stop. Mary, would you marry him?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> What, sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Would you condescend to marry him? Would you be
such a fool?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He wouldn’t marry me.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> So much the worse for him, then. [<i>To <span

out. You’re old enough to earn a living. Go.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Edward—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> My mind’s made up. There’s only one
alternative.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And what’s that, sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> That you do reparation. That you do the honest,
manly thing. It hasn’t occurred to you, it seems.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You mean?—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I can hardly advise her to do it. Mary, if you
marry him I’ll give him £300 a year so long as he behaves himself; if he doesn’t you
shan’t suffer.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Edward. Don’t be hasty, don’t decide too
quickly. I’m thinking of you, Mary, as well as of him.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I knew you’d be kind to me, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Edward, I pray that we may do right.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Come, sir. You had better go down on your knees and
woo your bride.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Oh! Edward; don’t speak like that.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> He’s not worthy of consideration.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I was thinking of her.</p>

What’s your answer?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mother, will you take Mary away and I will talk to

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> You will talk now and in Mary’s presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You care nothing about her. It’s simply that you’re
vexed with me. If you were doing it for her I could have some respect for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Your answer to my proposal.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What’s Edgar doing here? Surely we can do without
him.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">EDGAR.</span></i>] Stay
where you are.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mary, you know it’s impossible.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, Mr. Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mary refuses.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> So much the worse for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But if she refuses—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Out you go into the street.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> That can’t be.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> That shall be.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! This is all very absurd. We are not being
practical at all. Mary, I’m sorry. It’s no good you and me marrying. Now is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I suppose not, Mr. Leonard. I don’t know what I’m going
to do, though.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> My father can give you a bit of that £300 a year he
talks about. And then—Oh! of course, I don’t know. I should like to act handsomely but
what can I do? This talk of marriage—frankly—is a bit of antiquated Puritanism. Mary, I’m
sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. You’re a good girl. I’m all to blame. [<i>He turns to his
father who sits grimly silent, then to his mother.</i>] Mother, you settle it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I don’t know how.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You parents are in a middle stage. Once you’d just
have been brutal to the girl. I don’t mean you, but parents generally. Presently we may
have more sense. I’m a selfish brute but I’ve got some sense. But I’m powerless. [<i>To
his father.</i>] Haven’t you any imagination? It’s all<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span> very fine to make a scene here and put
down your foot and coerce me into your beastly righteousness but think of the years to
come. Do you see us married? Do you see our married life? Forgive me, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> You shall make an honest woman of her.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> A fine old phrase, that.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I’m not ashamed of it.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Why shouldn’t she be a happy mother without fear and
without shame? Mary, don’t make that ridiculous mistake of thinking yourself
disgraced.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> But I am disgraced.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You are not—Not in the eyes of any reasonable human
being.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Then the people I know aren’t reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Have you a father and mother?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And they would—they are—</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> They are very respectable.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I see, I see. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Didn’t you tell me you were ‘keeping company’
with someone?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I was walking out, ma’am. I wasn’t keeping company.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m afraid I don’t appreciate the difference.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> There is a difference.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Have you seen him lately?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Very quietly.</i>] Would he marry you now?
[<i><span class="name">TIMBRELL</span> starts in his chair, but does not speak. <span

he marry you, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> No, no, no, no.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Mary, will you marry my son?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He’d hate me.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Nonsense, will you marry him?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I’d like to marry someone. I’ve got to face my father.
He’ll be nasty.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> May I point out to you, sir—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Silence. You will do what you are told. You are not
one of us. You never have been. A useless dilettante. Here’s a chance for you. Don’t you
see that? A chance. If you can’t take it, it shall be forced on you. Will you marry him
Mary, or let him go out into the street?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> If he’s like as you say, it’s no great catch.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Mary!</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> She’s right. I’m no great catch. She’s the sensible
person in this conference. Let’s end it. Let’s do something else.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> We’ll finish this now. Edgar, fetch me the
Bible—the Family Bible. You know where it is—in the dining-room.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> But—what—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Loudly.</i>] At once. [<i><span

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> My dear—[<i><span class="name">TIMBRELL</span>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> The Family Bible! It’s like bringing out an obsolete
instrument of torture. I’d forgotten that we had a Family Bible.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> The names of my father’s children and their wives
and children are recorded there.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And a very nice old custom, too.</p>

unless I’m hypocritical. I think it is a nice custom.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Edward, let us think over this a little more.
Let us try to see things more clearly.</p>

doing?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> It’s Ada and—it’s Ada.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Loudly.</i>] Ada! And is Sheila there? Come in.
[<i>They enter immediately.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I told you so.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> What is it, father? What’s going to happen?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Put that Bible down here. [<i>Pointing to

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> Father, what are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Sheila, I thought your name would be the next to be
entered in this Book, but another is before you.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> Father, I don’t want to be hard on Mary, but really—I do
think—</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> I’m sorry for her but I think I ought to be
considered. My wedding’s spoilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Inadequate, inadequate. My dear Sheila, you’re
bringing us down to a lower level than we’ve reached yet.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I won’t stay. I thank you for your kindness ma’am. I
give you a month’s notice, but if I may I’ll go now without wages.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Just listen to her, Sheila. It may do you good.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Listen to this. [<i>He strikes the Bible with his
fist.</i>] I swear by this Book that unless my son, Leonard, marries that woman, Mary—What
is your name?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> My name is Mary Broome.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Mary Broome, he leaves this house—to-day—and never
again receives support in money or aught else from me. [<i>This is spoken standing. He
sits down heavily. A short pause.</i>] It is now between my son Leonard and Mary Broome.
[<i>He opens the Bible at the blank pages before the title page and, putting on his
spectacles, looks fixedly and inscrutably at the names inscribed there.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">EDGAR.</span></i>] I think
you ought to interfere.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Without looking up.</i>] If Sheila is not
satisfied with her sister-in-law she need not marry into this family.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> She would be my brother-in-law’s wife not my
sister-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You are saved.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I want to know whether I must write Mary Broome’s
name here.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> It’s after marriage you’d do that—not before.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> This time it’s before.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> It’s no use. I’ve never stood up against him.
I’ve let him have his own way all these years. It didn’t seem to matter.</p>

idea, Edgar. Humbugs like myself make good actors.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span>—You are not serious, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Hardly. No.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> I’ve heard that Harry Lauder got—how much a week

{ An accident!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAID.</span> Well, the soot came down the chimney just now and it’s
made such a mess. We’re just clearing it away but it’s a job. We’ll have to change the
tablecloth.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> [<i>Who has taken a great interest in this.</i>] That
damper wants a bit of coaxing but I expect it’s the coals. [<i>To <span
class="name">TIMBRELL,</span> reproachfully.</i>] You’ve not gone back to those cheap
coals again, sir? They do make such a lot of soot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Well—er—</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You would do it, you know. [<i>To <span
class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span></i>] Does your husband come and shew you how to save
money in the house?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> I’d like to see him try.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I’m afraid I don’t stand up against him. I’m
very weak. Well, get things straight as soon as you can, Beryl.</p>

<p>MAID. Yes, ma’am. It’ll be a little time yet. I’m afraid. [<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> What did you call her?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Beryl.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> Well, I never.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> She said that was her name.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I told you, my dear, that it was quite
unsuitable.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> She seemed to like the name.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I suggested Jane.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Ah! you may interfere about coals but not in things
that matter like this. Of course Beryl is abominable but when you know that Mother let the
poor girl stick to it—why! then it’s charming.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Well, we’ve a little time to put in, it seems. Mrs.
Pendleton, you haven’t seen the album that Sheila and I made up when we were honeymooning.
We took a lot and bought some. [<i>He gets out album and shows photographs. <span
class="name">SHEILA</span> and <span class="name">ADA</span> hover about.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Looking at his watch.</i>] Very annoying.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Don’t you bother.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>With an effort at geniality.</i>] Well, Mary,
my girl. It’s a shame to keep you waiting.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It doesn’t matter a bit, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Testily.</i>] Don’t call me Sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> No, sir—I mean No, Mr. Timbrell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Call him Daddy. She calls me Sir sometimes. I rather
like it. It feeds my vanity. What I like about Mary is that she has none of that absurd
pretence that woman is the equal of man.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> What nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> He always does talk nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I expect Mary keeps you in good order at home.
Do you Mary? Is he behaving nicely?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I think so sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Now what does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I find it so hard to understand him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> She’s simple. I’m ironical. I can’t get out of the
habit.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I’m stupid and I can only judge by what he does.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Ay, ay. That’s the devil. It’s explanations I’m good
at—not doing things.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> But I don’t understand the explanations.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Poor Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Did you understand him?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> He thinks I didn’t. But I’m afraid all this
will not interest our friends. We don’t let Mr. Pendleton have a word.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Oh! don’t mind me, ma’am. I’m all right.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And Mrs. Pendleton’s all right, I’m sure. She’s got
her eye on us. Of course, you know, Mrs. Pendleton, that Mary and I are—well—we’re rather
on show here. This is a social experiment. Now, why not go deeper into it? Mary’s manners
are quite nice. Anybody can see that. The housemaid’s manners are always better than those
of the daughter of the house. Now, father, keep quiet. My manners are what they always
have been. You see my point is that the question<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-35">[Pg 35]</a></span> whether we shall behave nicely on pleasant little family
occasions isn’t interesting. If you are really interested in Mary and me let’s try to go a
little deeper into things.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Perfect rubbish!</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It’s your weak point, sir. If I haven’t pointed it
out before I ought to have done—you will meet everything with exclamations and
interjections. Conversation can’t be carried on like that. There must be some reasonable
way of looking at me. I may be an extraordinary specimen, but you ought to get used to
me.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Never mind, Leonard, my boy, I was a bit eccentric
myself when I was young. I wanted to go on the stage.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I never wanted to go on the stage. I’m ready if
they’ll give me Harry Lauder’s salary.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Do you know what my old father did? He gave me a
good hiding and I’ve been all the better for it.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> [<i>With a shrug that is half exhibition.</i>]
Well—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I can hardly blame fathers. They are in an
impossible position. They pretend to teach and they ought to learn.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Who makes the position impossible? You and Edgar
were treated alike—up to a certain point. I never allowed any favouritism; what one got
the other got. There was never the slightest difference—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But why should you treat us alike when we were
totally different?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Up to a point, I said.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Surveying his brother.</i>] And this is the
success. I might have been like this if I’d tried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I was always ready to take a reasonable and a
liberal point of view.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Ah! You Liberals. It’s feeling that you’re so jolly
liberal that confirms you in your wickedness.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Wickedness!</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> A rhetorical term of course.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>With real dejection.</i>] I do my best but I
can’t understand your language. You puzzle me, my boy.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Don’t mind me, sir. I’m a rotter.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You want your dinner, Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, well, little mother. I’d like to know what you
think about it all.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> He’s a wild boy, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He can be very sensible if he likes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Don’t deny me my wildness. Don’t make me out a
sham.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Wild, wild.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And where does it come from? How do I get it? Mr.
Pendleton, who are the wild people here?</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Nay, my boy. I’m not up to your tricks and
turns.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’ll tell you. Mary and my mother—they’re very much
alike.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I think we’ll leave this subject.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You won’t get him away from himself.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Brother, brother, I’ll be silent if you’ve anything
worth saying.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You shouldn’t say I’m like your Mother.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But you are.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You make me unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Then I shouldn’t say it. But you are.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I’d be glad to think that I’m like you,
Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It’s all unhappy for me. I spoil everything.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> It isn’t your fault.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">ADA.</span></i>] You want to
blame it all on him. That’s no use. It isn’t all him.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> We want to be kind to you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It doesn’t matter about me. I’d rather you were down on
me and kind to him. This is his family. And I’m not comfortable ma’am and it’s partly this
dress and I wonder if you would mind if I went home and you’d all get on better together.
I spoil everything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You silly girl; you spoil nothing and you’re
as good as gold and we all like you.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> You mustn’t go, and the dress looks very nice.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Very nice, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> And you shall have a little shawl over your
shoulders if you like.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> All we want is our dinner.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I’m sure you’re all very kind—but—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> We’re getting on fine now.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You see, you’ve been out of the conversation for about
two minutes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Is that it, brother?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> What’s this trick of calling me brother?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m tasting the relationship. There’s a certain
piquancy in calling you brother.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Leonard, you won’t quarrel with your
brother.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No. And yet he’s one of the men I could quarrel
with. Once or twice I’ve been angry with Edgar. I’ve had the true intoxication of anger.
[<i>To <span class="name">EDGAR.</span></i>] Do you know it? It’s a delirious joy. Your
brain streams out like a scarlet banner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You quarrelled over trifles.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes, they would do. Our differences were deep.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Well, Pendleton. I hope you’re having a pleasant
evening.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> Oh! we don’t count this little bit of time
before dinner.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> I don’t like brothers to quarrel, though. I hope
you young fellows will make it up before the evening’s out.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> Well, you’ve got two very different sons,
Mrs. Timbrell.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Leave that, Maria.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Which favours the mother, Mrs. Pendleton?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> Why, Mr. Edgar.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No—no. You wouldn’t say that, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I’ve not said it. I’ve never said it.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Takes his Mother by the shoulders.</i>] You’ve
borne two sons little mother. How did you manage to make them so different? By God! You’re
nearer to me; you’re more like me. And like Mary; I tell you, you’re like Mary. A strain
of wildness. Yes. Where does my wildness come from? It comes from you. [<i>He shakes her
gently.</i>] I know you. Oh! you’re demure. I know you. I wonder what you were before you
became a respectable married woman. Ah! you cunning little one. You’ve doubled and turned
in your time; you’ve—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Stop, stop.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Monstrous.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> By Jove! this is too much.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Take your hands from her.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Turn the blackguard out.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I can’t believe—I can’t understand—this fellow is
too much for me.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> He’s too much for any of us.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>He looks again at his mother. She is very still
and droops a little.</i>] Mother! What did I say? Have I made a mistake? Have I hurt you?
I wouldn’t do that. [<i>He allows her to sink into a chair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> How could you say such things?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What did I say?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You made her out—no better than me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> Hush! Hush!</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I wouldn’t have said it but since she has—You dare
to suggest that your mother is no better than your wife?</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Now, come, Timbrell; that’s not the way to put
it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Mary is good enough for me.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> That isn’t the point. Don’t you yourself
resent—didn’t you hear what he said?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I thought he was a little cruel.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But who cares for you in this family as I do.</p>

<p><span class="name">ADA.</span> Who cares less? Who would treat her so abominably?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> My mother is to me an immaculate saint. To you—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What do I care for immaculate saints? What good are
they to me? My mother’s a strange woman. She has all kinds of curious reserves and she
lives among you quite like one of yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I will say this. He has always spoken beautifully about
her.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Bravo! Mary. Stand up for me.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I don’t wish to act hastily—I have tried hard to
control myself—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! be natural, sir. Be natural.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Go down on your knees, sir, and beg your Mother’s
pardon.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Certainly, if she wishes it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I do not wish it.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Do you realise what he said about you?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> He’s very clever. No doubt there’s some truth
in it.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Some truth? Some truth? Do you mean to say—I don’t
understand you. I don’t like to ask you what you mean—I—</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Now, Timbrell, I think we’d better leave it here.
[<i>To <span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span></i>] Don’t you think so, Maria?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. PENDLETON.</span> I should want to carry it a little further in
her place.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Having quite recovered.</i>] Would anybody
like to ask me any questions?</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> [<i>Shocked.</i>] Questions?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> About my early life. [<i>She gives a sad
little laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Questions! My dear madam—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> This is painful. This is quite impossible. [<i>To
his wife.</i>] I cannot understand you. I suppose you are trying to screen him.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He always speaks of his mother beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And why shouldn’t I when I admire her immensely? Why
can’t you people be natural and let me be natural? I say there’s a strange,<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-41">[Pg 41]</a></span> mysterious,
incalculable being behind her placid mask and you want to make out I mean something
beastly. How have you stood it all these years, mother? And they never seem to have found
you out.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Do you think I’ve found myself out?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’ve found the other people out and that’s very
much the same thing. I tell you what—you ought to come and live with me and Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It would be tremendously fine if you did that. After
all these years—it would be magnificent.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Is this to go on?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> No. I’m exceedingly sorry, Pendleton, that you and
Mrs. Pendleton should be in such a scene. [<i>To <span class="name">LEONARD.</span></i>]
I’ll ask you to leave the house. Mary may stay if she pleases.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But I want my dinner.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> You can get your dinner at home.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mary?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> There’s not much. I’ll go with you.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Now look here, Timbrell—</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Not a word. [<i>To <span

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m afraid it’s something nasty.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Yes, sir. It’s something nasty. I’ve been making
you an allowance at the rate of three hundred a year. It will stop at once.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Alarmed.</i>] Here! You can’t do that.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Can’t I? I will.</p>

that. How are we to live without it?</p>

this must be frightfully interesting to you. Mr. Pendleton, I shall want your help. I put
it to you as an honest business man—but you’re joking, sir; you’re joking. [<i><span

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> You’ll see whether I’m joking.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I shall allow her—[<i>considering</i>] I shall
allow her two pounds a week and see that it is paid to her.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> What you propose is unfair. You can’t do
it.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Perhaps you would like to go and live with them as
he proposes?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I’ve no income. You’ve never paid my

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Wages!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Yes, there’s something in what these suffrage
people say. I’m at your mercy I suppose. So is Leonard, so is Ada. I suppose Edgar is
getting out of your clutches.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Do you think to gain your point by talk like
this?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> No. This is for my own satisfaction. I’m vexed

more serious to consider.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Don’t talk about it now, either.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I don’t see how we can talk about anything else. We
must have an income. Mr. Pendleton, I appeal to you—</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Nay, let him calm down.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I shall not calm down. I am perfectly calm. The
fellow shall suffer. It will do him good.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I want to go home.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes, it’s all right for you when you get to your
baby.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I’ll follow you Mr. Pendleton.</p>

<p><span class="name">PENDLETON.</span> Well, I’ll just see what Timbrell’s up to now.
[<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I think you had better not stay.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> No, let us go.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’ve made a mess of it, mother.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Never mind that.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No. That doesn’t matter. But I’ve hurt you. I’ve
shaken you. You look pale and queer now. I’ve no reverence. I’m selfish. But I can
sympathise. Do you see that? I understand you better than anyone does, mother. I know you
better, I like you more. You don’t properly exist without me. Did I say some horrible
things about you? I really don’t know what I meant. It was a kind of inspiration. Oh! yes.
I know the proper things to say about one’s mother.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> But I’m a mother like the rest.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He doesn’t understand that. He wants to see all sorts
of things in you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> We’re just mothers, aren’t we, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> That’s the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes, Mary’s a mother. But what of you, poor thing?
Look at us. Look at Edgar and me and Ada. Look at the finished product. What’s the good of
it? What’s the good of being a mother when one’s children are grown up? I can understand
Mary. I’ve watched her with the baby. There’s been something suppressed and killed in
you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Don’t say these things to her.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Failure is written on her face.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Don’t, don’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m at my best in saying such things.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> But they hurt her. You only care for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> She must be hurt. We’ve let her alone all these
years. She ought to have revolted. She ought to be alive now.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I remember you all as babies, as children.
I’ve got the past.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Was I always your favourite, mother?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I won’t say that. [<i>She listens for a moment
to a distant sound.</i>] Perhaps you’d better go.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">EDGAR</span> enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Aren’t you coming, mother? It’s most awkward. There’ll
be an awful row.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Yes. Edgar, is it any use their coming? Mr.
Pendleton was going to see whether—</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> I don’t think it’s the slightest use. He’s boiling
over.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Oh! let us go.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Come on. But look here. It’s no use our going home.
Edgar, lend us a sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> You’d condescend to borrow from me, then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> My dear fellow you don’t seem to understand that I’m
magnanimous. [<i><span class="name">EDGAR</span> laughs.</i>] You think that’s a joke. You
never see my jokes.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> I can’t stay.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Have you any money about you, mother?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">EDGAR</span>.</i>]
Give it to him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mother will repay you out of the housekeeping.
[<i><span class="name">EDGAR</span> fumbles in his pocket.</i>] Look here. Make it two
pounds. Mary and I don’t often have a treat together. It’s a special occasion. We may as
well do it handsome for once. What about the Savoy and a music-hall, Mary? You look the
part fine. [<i>His spirits are obviously rising.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I wonder if I’d not better go home.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Go and enjoy yourself, my dear.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">EDGAR</span> hands money to <span

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, I’m damned. One pound ten.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Quite enough, too.</p>

extraordinary meanness of your character.</p>

<p>[<i>Rather poor lodgings. <span class="name">MARY</span>, neatly but very plainly
dressed, is sewing at a child’s garment. <span class="name">LEONARD</span> sprawls on the
sofa smoking cheap cigarettes. He is carelessly dressed to the point of slovenliness and a
little anxiety begins to shew through his calmness which is generally maintained. It is
afternoon. Two or three months have elapsed.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I don’t think it’s that the old man’s mean. He’s got
on the high horse and doesn’t know how to get down.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> We oughtn’t to take the money from your mother. It’s
very hard for her.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! but it only means that she gives them rice
pudding instead of gooseberry tart. It’ll do them good. I expect the old man sees the
difference and pretends he doesn’t. And Edgar will be furious.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> If little Leonard had a brother and they were like you
and your brother—I couldn’t bear that.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It’s a long way off, old lady.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Thing’s aren’t a long way off if you think they might
come.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Don’t worry, now. Don’t worry.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I’m a great deal happier than you. I’ve got him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, haven’t I?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> No, you haven’t. Not like me.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You don’t think I’m such a bad father, do you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I don’t know. You’re funny with him and I like to see
you together but—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You keep spending the money.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But, Mary, you don’t know how much more I could
spend if I had it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> And, so clever as you are, you don’t make any—I mean
don’t make much.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You see, in my trade, the better you are the more
wretchedly you get paid.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You keep telling me that.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And you don’t believe it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, I do. I think you mean it. I don’t think it can be
quite true. I think you could get more money if you tried. You’re clever enough to write
the way they want.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What do you care for most in the world—barring the
baby?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> [<i>Considering.</i>] I don’t think there’s anything.
Oh! I beg your pardon. Of course there’s you.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Never mind me. Could you believe that I care more
about writing my own way than for anything?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I suppose it’s good to care for something but that
seems selfish.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’re beginning to feel a bit of resentment. You
don’t hate me yet, do you?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> No, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I shouldn’t blame you. You’re a wonderfully
even-tempered person. I sometimes wonder whether I’m right about that streak of wildness
in you. Do you think you could do strange things—what shall I say—wicked things?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I’ve done one wicked thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Does it trouble you, Mary? Does it still trouble
you? Would you alter it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Then I shouldn’t have little Leonard. I can never
understand. If I’d known of him—if I’d thought of little Leonard—then it couldn’t be
wrong. But how could I think of him when he wasn’t born? It was wicked. It wasn’t like
me.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You did think of him, Mary. No, you didn’t think.
It’s not thought. It was nature—something bigger than you—forcing you—forcing you to bring
little Leonard into the world. Now, take comfort in that, my girl; there is some comfort
in it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I can’t see what it’s got to do with <i>him.</i> It’s
not children I care for; it’s him. Well, he’s here now. I’ve got him now.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Quite right, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> But I think he ought to have Lubbock’s food regularly
and we <i>must</i> have a perambulator.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, this must go. [<i>Taking out his
watch.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Would you? Will you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Looking ruefully at the watch.</i>] You’d better
take me at my word. My generous moods don’t last.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Shall I take it?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He is slowly unhooking the watch when there is a knock at the
door and <span class="name">MRS. GREAVES,</span> the </i>landlady,<i> comes in. He puts the watch

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I should like a word, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> A whole history if you like, Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> Sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I was only quoting Shakespeare, Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I know nothing about him, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> He’s the man that writes the plays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> There’s some people too fond of plays and such
things.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Now I hope you’re not going to attack Shakespeare,
Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’m attacking nothing, sir, but I should like a
word and perhaps it would be more pleasant if Mrs.—the lady wasn’t here.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Why mustn’t Mrs. the lady be here?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> It’s as you like.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Fire away.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I must tell you, perfectly frank, that there’s
been some talk about you. I know that lady that comes here to see you is your mother and
that I don’t understand. But I’ve heard tell of carryings on with a housemaid and it is
said as you’re not married. I know mothers ’ll do a good deal for their sons but I must
say—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Who says this?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> It’s not only one. There’s Mr. Whales, the
milkman, and he does a good round and hears a lot—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> We shall have no more dealings with Mr. Whales.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> You wouldn’t, anyhow, till he got paid.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> No more milk?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> No, and it’s not only milk.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mrs. Greaves, this lady is my wife and anyone who
says she isn’t is telling an abominable lie. I’m surprised that you should listen to such
stuff.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> Of course I know she’s got on a ring and all
that but that’s what they do and I can’t afford to be out of my money; I really can’t. I
don’t want to be hard but my account must be settled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Now first of all, Mrs. Greaves, you will apologise
to my wife. Then we’ll settle the other matter.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’m sure I’m sorry if there’s been a mistake.
I’ve no call to make mischief. I’ll ask your pardon ma’am very willing, but Mr. Whales, he
said—and he’s only saying what others—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No more of that, now, if you want to have your bill
paid.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> You can be made to pay.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And so can you be made to pay. Do you know what
you’ve done?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> Done? I know I’ve been done.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Good, Mrs. Greaves—very good—I’m glad you can joke
about it. It may be no joke for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It’s slander. They give very heavy damages now for
slander.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’ve only mentioned what I’ve been told.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes, that’s slander. It’s sometimes called
defamation of character. Same thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’m sure I’d no intention at all of saying
anything—I’ve been very lenient, too.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Perhaps you’ll give me the name of your Solicitor,
Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> What for? I haven’t got a solicitor. I don’t
understand what you want.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I think he’s joking, Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>With mock vexation.</i>] Tut! tut!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> [<i>Doubtfully.</i>] I know slander’s a nasty
law but I can’t see as I’ve said anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It’s not all a joke, Mary. You may tell your Whales
and people that if I hear another word about it I go straight to a Solicitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’ll tell him, sir.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Very well. You may go, Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Solicitors like to be paid, too.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> [<i>Turning at the door.</i>] And what about my
bill, sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It shall be attended to.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’ve heard that very often.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It is a bit stale, isn’t it? I apologise for the old
wheeze. Well, you see, there’s the perambulator first.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> The what, sir?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> The first money we get is for a perambulator—no. The
first is for a pint or a peck, or whatever it is, of what’s-his-name’s food for the baby.
Second, the perambulator. You’re only third, Mrs. Greaves. Rather a bad third, but your
turn will come.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It’s not fair to her. She ought to be paid.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Of course she ought. We ought all to be paid. I’m in
favour of handsome incomes all round and I hope Lloyd George will take it up. But, look
here, Mrs. Greaves, we’re all in the same boat. Now is there anything <i>you’d</i> like to
pawn? I’m treating you as a friend.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> There’s your watch.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> There’s my watch. My wife suggests my watch. A
nuisance to me, of course. As a friend, Mrs. Greaves, what do you say to that?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I should be sorry, sir, but I must have my
money.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You shall have it with compound interest at 5 per
cent. Do you know what that means?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I think so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It’s more than you can get safely elsewhere so it
means that the longer we keep you out of your money the more it will be to your
advantage.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I think you’re a funny gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">MARY.</span></i>] She’s
found me out.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Mrs. Greaves, we’ve got some money coming in a day or
two. At least I think so. But I’m anxious about the baby and I must have some for it. I
will pay you. I will.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> Can you give me a little?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, you shall have something to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I think I know of an old perambulator.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Do you? Could we borrow it. We’d pay when we could.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’ll see.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Thank you, Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I don’t want to be hard.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You’ve been very kind.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> P’raps there’d be no harm in letting the doctor
have a look at the baby.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Do you think so? Do you think he’s—</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> He looks a little bit peaked.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You know about babies, too, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I should do. I’ve had seven of my own.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> We’ll have the doctor. And thank you, Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. GREAVES.</span> I’ve been a bit soft, I know that.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Will you sell your watch, then, or pawn it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> And will you bring the doctor first?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Now, is that necessary?</p>

enough.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Where’s all this money to come from?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> There’s your watch. I’ve not many things. Some of my
clothes could go. I can’t lose my wedding-ring.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She moves towards the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I’m going to look at him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Wait a moment. This is getting serious. I’ll write
to my mother again. I’ll ask her to come. It’s absurd. He thinks he’s teaching me a
lesson. I suppose he is. Mary, do you remember exactly what he said that day—I mean about
the three hundred pounds? The old man’s very particular about keeping his word. That sort
of people always are.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Shall I explain to you what a promise is?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Ah! Yes. It would spoil you to understand these
things; and I’m losing all my lightness of touch. I was rather stupid just now with Mrs.
Greaves. I didn’t handle it well.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You must go to your father and tell him how we are.
It’s different now I’m frightened about little Leonard. I’ll go if you don’t. I can get
milk. I don’t want to do it but if I must I will.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Milk!</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You heard her say that Mr. Whales wouldn’t let us have
any more. George Truefit will let me have some.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> George Truefit?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, I shall be ashamed to go to him but I’ll do
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I had forgotten about George Truefit.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I hadn’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> My rival, the milkman, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, he’s a milkman.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> There’s something rather piquant in this. I wonder
whether George Truefit would appreciate it. I suppose he wouldn’t poison the milk?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Poison the milk!</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No, I <i>am</i> getting a bit heavy-handed. That’s
stupid. What is he like? What’s George like?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He’s—he’s—you know where you’ve got him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I think you understand me very well. It’s only the
things I say you don’t understand. Poor girl. I bewilder you. You’re quite right. I’m what
you see. You keep thinking you don’t understand and that I may be better than that. You’re
a brave, humble person. By God! There’s no one like you. I wish I was different. I wish I
was like George Truefit.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Only a little bit like him. Yourself, too.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What must I do to be saved?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Now, you’re talking queer again.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What is it you want? I see you watching me anxiously
sometimes. I can’t make myself into another person but I’d like to please you. What do you
want me to do?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I suppose it’s a lot of little things.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yes, yes. Can you tell me some of them?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> While we’re talking here you might have gone for the
doctor.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> The doctor?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You forget him. You often forget all about little
Leonard. [<i>Rising.</i>] I must go to him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Ah! Yes. Mrs. Greaves said he was peaked. Peaked!
Good word isn’t it? Shakespeare has it, you know: “Shall he dwindle, peak and pine”—</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> But you don’t think he’s pining, do you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No, no. I’m only quoting the poet.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Why do you say things like that—just to amuse
yourself—and you might know they frighten me? That’s it. You don’t think of other
people—except now and then when you seem to get interested.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’ll go for the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Anything else I can do?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Would they trust us for Lubbock’s food?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’ll pawn my watch.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Wait. We’ll see what the doctor says.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, I won’t be five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Thank you very much indeed.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No, my dear girl, don’t put it like that. [<i>There
is a ring at the front door bell.</i>] Anyone for us I wonder.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Oh! I must tell you. My mother might come. My father
will come too, but he couldn’t get off now.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Of course you’ve got parents, too, haven’t you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Don’t you ever think of that?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But where have they been all this time?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> They didn’t know where I lived.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> They could have got the address from my mother.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I wrote and told them I’d gone to Canada. I felt I
couldn’t face them then.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And now?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> My mother knows a lot about babies. I want to see her.
You won’t like them, I’m afraid. I think someone’s coming in.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! I’m sure I shall find them quite amusing. No, I
don’t mean that. I mean interesting. Interesting; that’s what I mean when I say amusing.
They’re coming up.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> That’s my father’s voice.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Let’s see—what does he do?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He’s a cabman.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Heavens! Are there such things still! A growler or
what?</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> They wouldn’t give me a try if I wanted. And I don’t
want. I wouldn’t touch the things.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’ve had the bad luck to be attached to a decaying

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> Decaying my eye! There’s no call for it to decay.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You don’t hold with modern notions—progress and
things, Mr. Broome?</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> I don’t hold with taxis. They’ll find out their
mistake.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. BROOME.</span> He will talk like that.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> And so would you if you’d druv a cab twenty-nine
years.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> But the taxis go faster, father, and you’ve only got to
pay the same.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> Never mind that. Why should they injure a established
trade? Why should they spoil other trades? What’s a country without its trades?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. BROOME.</span> That’s the way he talks.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> Mark my words. They’ll find out their mistake. Look

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Yours is an interesting type of Conservatism.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> I’m not a Conservative. I’m a radical.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. BROOME.</span> You voted Tory last time.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> Yes, and what have they done for me? I don’t hold
with Socialism but I may be druv to it.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> And what’s your perfession, sir, if I may ask?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, it’s rather hard to define, Mr. Broome. What
am I, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> He writes things.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> What things?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Well, shall we say—sketches, critical impressions,
verses, even stories.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> Hardly work for a man is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Now—father!</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Perhaps not. You see, Mr. Broome, you and I are at
the opposite ends. Without offence, I hope, I referred to yours as a decaying industry.
With me it’s the other way. They’re not ready for me. </p>

sir, it’s as plain to me as if I’d been told that your father’s cut up rough about
this.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’re quite right.</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> He wouldn’t have you marry my gel<span

young feller in love—in love mindyer—you ups and you sez: I’ll marry her so’s ’ow. It’s as
plain as mud—</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It does look like that, doesn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">BROOME.</span> It’s on’y the other day I was readin’ a bit of a
novelette in the paper—just to pass the time—and there was a young feller who did just
like that and the father says it’s a cut off of a shillin. I said there’s a bit of human
natur’ there but I didn’t expect to see it in my own family so soon.</p>

the thing. Just what I want.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Where?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> His place down in Norfolk. Fishing. Of course the
fishing’s not much but he’s got some rather good men there. By Jove! I see myself talking
again. I mean really talking. Just the thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mary! Well, no. But there’s no nonsense of that kind
about Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Then you may be sure there’s nothing the matter.
Good. Things are looking better. [<i>To his mother.</i>] Do you think the Governor would
let me have twenty pounds? Is he far enough round for that?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You’d soon have him back again if you
tried.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It’s awkward. I must get some things. And I’ve no
fishing rod. I might say I’d lost it on the way down. I must lose a bag, if necessary, and
borrow. Rather thin, though. Did Edgar leave his rod at home? Could you manage ten pounds?
What did you give Mary?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Is there any hope for him, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> What? Oh! the baby—I keep forgetting about that
blessed baby. But he’s not ill. I’m sure he’s not ill. Look here! I must get away. I shall
hate you, Mary, if you stop me. I want a change, as the doctors say. I want to talk to
these chaps. They’re men you can talk to. I must go. I must go. I’m a flower turning to
the light, I’m a prisoner breaking from his dungeon, I’m a spirit winging upwards. Don’t
stop me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Why should I stop you? You want to be there. I want to
be here.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Ah! yes. And if the child <i>is</i> ill you’ve got a
beautiful time before you. A mother with her child ill is lovely, lovely. I could come
home to see it. Especially if those fellows get rather dull. Cochrane doesn’t mention a
time. I wonder how long he’ll have me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> If anyone could change you, Mary would, but
you don’t change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Don’t change! I’m always changing. I’m a perfect
Kaleidoscope.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Always a Kaleidoscope.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Taking his mother by the shoulders.</i>] You
just go and get me some money, will you? Tell the old boy I’m a new man, a reformed
character. Put in a good word for Mary. Tell him she’s done it. Then see if you can’t get
fifty pounds out of him.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You’d kill the goose with the golden eggs,
before it laid any. Mary, we’d better let him go.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Oh! yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You must have some money? What’s the least you
can manage with?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> The least? Well, I should say the least is the most
I can get.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Fingering her rings.</i>] Have you started
with pawnshops yet?</p>

and gives it to him.</i>] Take that.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> No, no. He can’t do that.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I think he can.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Of course I can. I thought you would understand,
Mary. A mother’s sacrifice for her son is one of the most beautiful things—just think what
you would do for little Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, if there’s need.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Need? There is need. But wouldn’t like to deprive
her of the pleasure. The pleasure! It’s a sacred joy. Isn’t it mother?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You’re a humbug.</p>

can’t be less than a mother because<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

better to sell it out and out to a jeweller. You don’t mind, mother?</p>

me back.</p>

know. Isn’t she, Mary? I suppose a lot of mothers do the kind of things that she does for
their sons but she does them lightly. She can be witty over it.</p>

him. And a very proper letter in the circumstances. Of course he did very wrong. He
acknowledges that. Undoubtedly he ought to have been there. He does make certain
explanations and apologies. He expresses himself to me in a suitable manner. Now, Mary, I
have been talking to Mrs. Timbrell and we wish you to understand that we are pleased with
you. We think that as far as you can—according to your lights—you have made him a good
wife. You’ve had rather a hard time. Well, I thought it right that there should be what I
may call an ordeal—a period of ordeal. I hope we may consider that over and that things
may be made a little easier for you. I think after the letter I have received from Leonard

sorts of charming memories of him—of him with you, Mary.</p>

something inscrutable in you. It seems to me that we’re just as uncomfortable as ever.
Mother, let’s have a little motherliness or something. I don’t know how it is but I want
cheering up. I came from the station most penitentially in a growler—an ancient
fourwheeler. It made me think of your father, Mary. How is that good man? Got a job all
right? By-the-bye, there’s an extraordinary upset at our place. I wanted to ask you about

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> This is the strangest thing that has ever happened
to me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I thought it would surprise you.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> But Mary, you’re my wife.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes. That’s what I don’t like about it.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I did wrong to stay away from you. I acknowledge it.
I feel it. I’m going to be good. I’ll try. I’m going to be a good husband. I don’t want
you to go. It was dreadful of me to stay away when the little kiddie died. I’m not like
that. I’m not like the things I do.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> After all, you wrote a beautiful letter.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Despairingly, to the Universe.</i>] She’s taking
to irony now.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> [<i>She has approached <span class="name">MARY</span>
rather timidly and stands beside her.</i>] Don’t go, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Oh! Miss Sheila!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> I want you to stay. I do. And I’m so sorry about
everything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Oh! I must. Thank you—thank you. I must.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> [<i>To <span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span></i>]
Won’t you stop her?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I don’t know how.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Perhaps I may have a few words with this young
woman. I think I am entitled to a few words. Now, I don’t wish to be harsh with you. Far
from it. I had formed—I was forming a high opinion of your character—of some phases of it.
I was prepared, as I think I have said, to accept you—to have overlooked the deplorable
incident which—I will say no more about that. My son has been rather unfeeling, perhaps. I
don’t defend him. He is anxious to make amends. I must remind you that at a time when—that
I insisted on his making reparation. It was an unusual course. I conceived it to be my
duty. Later I found it necessary in certain painful circumstances to impose what I may
call an ordeal. It is over. I am willing to be lenient. I should propose, if your husband
remains reasonably—what shall I say?—steady, to make your pecuniary position a much easier
one. Now, my good girl, I hope we shall have no more of this nonsense. I can overlook a
slip—an error due to—an error of—of youth, but not a deliberate infringement of—are you
listening to what I say?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I beg your pardon, sir. I was thinking it was time I
was off.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Oh! This is abominable.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It’s no good your talking, sir. I’ve made up my
mind.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> And does he—this person—this<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-80">[Pg 80]</a></span> Truefit know the whole
of the extraordinary circumstances?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I’ve told him everything.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Where is he? I’ll see him.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> You won’t move George Truefit.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I should like to see him. I don’t mean to talk and
argue and all that. And I don’t want to break his head. But I should like to have a look
at him through a keyhole or something.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Manly talk.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mary, do you like him better than me?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It’s not the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It’s deuced interesting if one weren’t so close to
it. As it is I feel rather uncomfortable. Unmanly. Yes, I suppose so. I suppose things are
easy for these manly people. They just go to work with an axe. But how do I know that she
isn’t right? Mary, I’m horribly uncomfortable. I’m unhappy. I seem to be losing something.
Yes, really losing something. Are you quite sure about George Truefit?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Yes, I’m sure about him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> And yourself? Do you think you’ll never want to come
back? To me, you know?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> To you or to fifty others.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> No—no.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! he doesn’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Understand! I understand that this is an abandoned
woman. You are well rid of her. I’ve been mistaken. Yes, I made a mistake. She has been
treated with some magnanimity. [<i>Snappishly to <span class="name">LEONARD.</span></i>]
Not by you. Let her go, then, to her life of infamy.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> For shame!</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Silence!</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It’s no good my talking here but I’d like you to
understand ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I do understand.</p>

<p><span class="name">SHEILA.</span> Don’t go.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> No. Don’t go.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I must go. I can’t throw over George Truefit.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You are throwing me over.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> That doesn’t matter. That’s another thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! Is it? Why?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> It was all wrong from the beginning. I brought it on
myself. I’m sorrier for my mother than anyone. She told me there were men like you. I
wouldn’t have gone if little Leonard had lived. Not if I’d had to leave him. But now
George Truefit and I have talked it over and we think we see what’s right. It can’t be
right but it’s not so wrong as other things.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Mary, do you love George Truefit?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> Now, that’s what I’ve said to myself sometimes. And
people talk of love and stories are full of it. I can’t make out rightly what it is. Did
you love me when first—They talk about a mother loving. Well—little Leonard—are they the
same? If that’s love I don’t love George. But I want to be sure of things. I want things
to last. I want to feel that I’m faithful and true. It’s strange for me to be running away
from my husband for that. I’m not one of the kind that does it. It’s funny that I’m
leaving you because I want to be a proper wife. P’raps I’m all wrong. It’s hard for a girl
like me, not very clever, to make out things. It’s all been very unusual. I may be wrong
but I can’t help it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> You are not wrong, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> This is madness. Are you going to justify her
now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Ah! You don’t understand this, sir. It’s a little
out of your line.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I hope it is out of my line, sir. I trust it
is.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> When are you going, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> We sail to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I suppose the magnanimous thing would be for me to
see you off.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> No. I’ll say good-bye here. [<i>To <span
class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span></i>] I’m sorry to leave you ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Good luck, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> There’ll be no questions asked there. I shall leave it
all behind. I should be ashamed here. I’ve felt so all the time. Why! Mrs. Greaves thought
I wasn’t married. And I never felt as if I was, properly. Of course it’s wrong, but I
can’t be right now whatever I do. It isn’t as if I’d been straight all the time. Somehow
that does make me feel a bit freer now. If I’m wrong it’s the best I can do.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Angrily to <span
class="name">LEONARD.</span></i>] Do you mean to tell me that you’re going to submit to
this?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I don’t see that a scrap with George Truefit would
help much. I’ve lost Mary. That’s plain.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Well, well. I’ve no more to say.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> It has been an extraordinarily interesting episode.
The most stimulating thing that ever happened to me. I must thank you for that, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Turning suddenly on <span
class="name">LEONARD.</span></i>] Doesn’t it hurt you. Can you get outside it like
that?</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Oh! Yes. It hurts me splendidly.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Your conduct is despicable, sir. The man who allows
his wife to leave him is not a man.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> [<i>Snappishly.</i>] Oh! Don’t talk rubbish.<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-83">[Pg 83]</a></span> Your wife left you long
ago. She never came to you. You’ve never had a wife.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I don’t understand you. I don’t want to understand
you. I pray that I may never understand you.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> Of course you don’t want to understand. That’s just
it. I think sometimes that people like you are just as intelligent as we are but you’re
timid, you daren’t let your thoughts stray, you have secrets from yourselves. Well,
mother, I shall have to look to you now Mary’s gone.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> I can do nothing for you. You’ve ceased to be
a child.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> To him—to my father—Yes. Not to you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. TIMBRELL.</span> Yes. You know too much. You can only pretend
to be my child.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> I’m to be alone, then. Mary, I shall be quite
alone.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I daresay you’ll pick up somebody.</p>

<p><span class="name">LEONARD.</span> You’ve no sentiment at all.</p>

<p><span class="name">MARY.</span> I must go. Good-bye, ma’am.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="name">MARY</span> and <span class="name">MRS.
TIMBRELL</span> embrace. <span class="name">MARY</span> moves toward the door. The others,
with the exception of <span class="name">TIMBRELL,</span> follow her, <span

advances to his father.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> What’s this?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> [<i>Testily.</i>] What’s what?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Some sort of family reconciliation?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Gone?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Take care Sheila doesn’t go.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> Sheila?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Perhaps she’s gone already.</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> I’ve been listening to the ravings of lunacy and
they’ve affected my brain. I’m getting old. Do you ever have any doubt about yourself,
Edgar? Do you ever think you’re a fool?</p>

<p><span class="name">EDGAR.</span> No, I don’t think I’m a fool.</p>

<p><span class="name">TIMBRELL.</span> Neither am I.</p>
